Streetwear Sales EDA Project
Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Streetwear sales dataset to extract meaningful insights and trends. The goal is to understand sales patterns, identify top-selling products, and provide actionable recommendations for business strategy. The analysis uses Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features

* Comprehensive analysis of sales data including product categories, quantities, and revenue trends

* Visualization of key insights through bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and scatter plots

* Identification of top-selling products and seasonal sales patterns.

* Detection of anomalies and missing data for better data quality understanding.

* Summary insights that can assist in inventory management and marketing strategies.
